Reds in Pradise was my first game project that I took further then just a basic set of levels with simple mechanics.
It's the game where developed my main design philosophy of created a powerful and modular foundation that can be expanded in any direction I wanted.
The concept of the game was a movement based fps with a game loop inspired the free flow style combat found in the newer DOOM games and gamemodes like gungame in Call of Duty.
The game has the Player go through levels either silently or loudly to reach the exit; on the way the Player comes across many enemies that they'll have to fight with either melee weapons or 
by picking up guns from the ground or from dead enemies (as the Player can't reload or hold onto multiple weapons).

This was originally made for my Design Prototyping Fundamentals unit at AIE but then quickly turned into my experimental project where I worked on all sorts of systems within Unreal Engine 5. I started with a basic shooting system that refilled whenever you killed an enemy. 
The enemies were powered by very static AI that was only capable of one thing at a time. That was then heavily upgraded into the project in this portfolio. 
The AI now fully utilses a proper behaviour tree that dynamically changes depending many conditions, some from the enviornment and others from the enemy type. 
The Player's weapon also now fully comprised of it's own strong but versitile weapon system.

In general, this project will showcase some of my best when it comes to my ability to design and develop fun and versatile game mechanics and systems.
