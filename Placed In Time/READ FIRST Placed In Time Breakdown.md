Placed In Time was my first major project done with a full team of Designers, Artists, and Programmers. The project was made as part of my Production unit for my first year at AIE.
The entire production lasted for 3 two-week sprints starting on the 30th of October and ending on the 6th of December. There was also an additional sprint specifically for planning and concept development.
We had 4 prompts to choose from, the one we ended up choosing asked for a walking simulator about mindfulness and meditation, we picked it as it played best with our team's strengths; 
we didn't want to choose anything too technical as we only had 1 Programmer but we were more open to more artistic games due to our team's excess of Artists. Our general concept was a 
walking simulator about going back through your childhood memories and finding an object that was important to you at that time. It involves the Player going through different times in 
their life and completing puzzles to find the specific item, the Player can also meditate for a hint of what they need to do if they are ever stuck.

The final build of Placed In Time contains 5 different levels. 2 puzzle levels and 3 different versions of a hub area. The Player would start in the hub level before sleeping on the couch and 
transitioning to the next puzzle level; after completing the puzzle level, the Player would return to a different version of the hub that is now filled with items from the level that was just played. 
The Player would then sleep again to transition to the next level. The final hub level includes the credits and a small cutscene before the game ends. The game's story focuses on a person 
returning home from a deadbeat job and lacking in motivation to make music (a hobby they used to love). They then start reliving their past and regaining that passion for music.

My main role focused on level greyboxing, technical design with the programmer, QA testing & polishing, as well as general team management and ensuring that all the work that 
my team had done appeared in the game's build for that day.
