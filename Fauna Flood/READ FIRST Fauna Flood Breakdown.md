Fauna Flood is a FPS tower defence game that I made with 2 other Designers as part of a 2 1/2 day game jam at AIE. The prompt we were given was 
"Green" and we were allowed to interpret it however we wanted, my team decided to interpret it as a green forest. The team we had was very technically capable, 
and one of the Designer even had experience with Blender and had premade assets that could be used for the game; so we chose to give ourselves 
the challenge of making an RTS game within the time limit, specifically a tower defence game where the Player is on the ground with the "towers". 

The game was inspired by Bloons TD and Plants vs Zombies (especially Garden Warfare), we wanted to make a tower defence that puts the Player on 
the battlefield and prevents them from just standing idly by after placing their towers. The core loop of the game starts with the Player 
purchasing seeds from the "Mothertree" using charcoal, they then plant those seeds before the wave begins, during the wave, the Player 
replaces any plants that die while using their shovel to protect themselves until they kill the last enemy and the wave ends.

My main role during production was mainly handling the technical of the game, this included the AI for the enemies and the plants as well as 
the enemy/wave manager. Despite the short time, I was able to design & code a very competent set of systems that were extremely modular and 
surprisingly quick to get set up.
