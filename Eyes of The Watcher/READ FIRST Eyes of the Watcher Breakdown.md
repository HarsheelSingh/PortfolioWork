Eyes of the Watcher was made for my Narrative Design unit at AIE. Unlike my other projects, I chose to make this in Twine instead of Unreal as I wanted to start learning a new engine and especially HTML and JavaScript;
I also planned to make the game fully text based so I would be able to fully focus on the story and it's characters so compared to Unreal, Twine was a much better engine and required a lot less set up to get working.

Eyes of the Watcher takes place in a fictional version of LA known as Merivion City in an alternate universe where science given less moral tolerances; it tells the story about a kid named Deacon who becomes the latest 
in a linage of vigilantes known as the Watchers, selfless and couragous humans who taken in at young age by the previous Watcher and are trained both physically and mentally before getting genetically mutated to push their bodies to their absolute limits 
and allow them to pretect the City completely on their own. While this process has been many time in the game's world, Deacon is a special case as he is the youngest to ever be turned into a Watcher (at the age of 16) making his experience both more devestating
(as Watcher's sacrifice a large portion of their life to given their powers) but also intspirational due to Deacon's dedication to protecting the city (at least at first). How Deacon handles these newly gained powers and responcailities is fully up to the Player
and the choices they make (and even don't make).

The story took inspiration from many different sources, from Spiderman's innocient persona as Peter Parker to Batman's constant struggle with balancing brutality and saving people's lives, to the structure of the Witcher schools and the interesting set pieces 
that a world similar to Cyberpunk 2077 can offer. 

Designing the way the story was told was also difficult as I wanted it to involve small choices that built up to major changes to the story, and considering that we only had a couple weeks for unit, I had to come up with a system that at least emulated 
the style of storytelling that I wanted. In the end, I decided to focus a majority of choices around three different stats that had effects over the entire story, efficiency (how successful was the Player at saving people), brutality (how extreme was the Player when dealing with criminals), 
and violance (did the Player kill and how often); this allowed me to crame as many choices (and even scene varients) as I could possibly want while still making them feel meaningful since they will always affect the story by simply modifing the variables.

In general, this project is easily the best at showcasing my ability to Design and tell a story.
