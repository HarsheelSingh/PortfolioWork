To The Depths was a roguelike horror game that I designed as part of my Psychology and Economies unit for my year 2 game design course at AIE. 
It was originally designed to be a premium game like I usually design, but part way into the unit, my teacher decided to give the class the challenge 
of changing our games to instead be free-to-play, we also had to design the monetization of our games with the new model. Despite the daunting task, 
I was able to split my game into two sections with one section having all of the game's microtransactions and ads, while the other sections were fully 
focused on gameplay and the Player's experience allowing for a fairly undisruptive transition to free-to-play.

The general design of the game was inspired by games like Lethal Company and Deep Rock Galactic but with a bigger focus on the Player consistently 
risking their lives to keep a loot run going and to get greater rewards. The Player would start in a town where they could purchase items and upgrades, 
as well as contribute to their quota. They would then enter an elevator into the mines that then place them into the loop of searching the level, mining ore, 
collecting ore, and either transitioning to the next level to continue their run and massively improve their final total or return to the surface, cashing in what they have, 
and ending the day. This GDD is one of the most in-depth documents that I've made for a project that hasn't been actually developed yet. I showcased a lot of detail within 
each system and mechanic within the game, I especially spent a lot of time designing the AI monsters to act exactly how I wanted them to. To showcase certain aspects of the game's design, 
I also made two prototypes, one in Unreal that showcases the basic movement and mining, as well as a prototype for the town and risk economy, made in machinations as it proved easy to work 
with and set up for the economy I wanted. A video of the Unreal prototype can be found in the GDD in the mechanics section, while a link to the economy prototype can be found in 
the "Town&RiskEconomyPrototype" document, the document also includes previous iterations of the prototype and how it evolved over time.

In general, these documents will showcase the best of my core game & technical design skills in a theory environment.
